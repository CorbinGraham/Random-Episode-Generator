# Random-Episode-Generator
  I have created this as a personal project just to improve my programming ability. It was initially created in my first year and improved
  upon in the years following.

## Project Details
  The program itself pulls from 2 seperate text files to build objects which represent indpendent episodes of the Simpsons. An episode
  object is randomly selected and displayed for the user.
